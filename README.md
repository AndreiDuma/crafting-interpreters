## Haskell and Java implementations of Lox

Lox is the language described in Robert Nystrom's excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com). This repository contains:

- [Hlox](https://github.com/AndreiDuma/crafting-interpreters/tree/main/hlox): my Haskell implementation of the tree-walk interpreter for Lox;
- [Jlox](https://github.com/AndreiDuma/crafting-interpreters/tree/main/jlox): the Java implementation, as described by Robert Nystrom in his book.
